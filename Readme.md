## HOW TO RUN:

**For windows:**  
-> Edit EticaPool8081.cmd: Replace the address field with your Etica address (be careful not to put your private key instead!)  
-> Save the file  
-> Run EticaPool8081.cmd as admin (right click and the click on run as admin)  

**For Linux:**  
-> Edit EticaPool8081Linux.sh: Scroll to the right of file, find and replace address=0x9172ff7884CEFED19327aDaCe9C470eF1796105c by address=youraddresshere  
-> Save the file  
-> Run EticaPool8081Linux.sh  


# Version 2.3.4:  
- fixed AMD OPENCL memory leak  
- fixed fan and temp stats on HiveOS and in console (AMD/NVIDIA)  
- restore memclock on stop on HiveOS (if 810 was used) (NVIDIA)  
- added stopTemp and startTemp params (default: 90C and 80C) (AMD/NVIDIA)  
- added version info to HiveOS  
- stability improvements

NOTES
For HiveOS, refer to 'GuideForHiveOS.txt' on how to get started.
For EthOS, refer to 'GuideForEthOS.txt' on how to get started.
Do refer to 'GuideForPoolMining.txt' and 'GuideForSoloMining.txt' on how to get started.
Configuration is based on CLI (similar to ccminer), except ".abi" files are required for new tokens (You can manually create one and copy from etherscan.com -> Contract -> Code -> Contract ABI).
Note that there is a configuration file "SoliditySHA3Miner.conf" that saves previous CLI parameters/settings, delete it prior to changing CLI parameters.
Sample CLI launch parameter can be found in the ".bat" and ".sh" file found together with this miner, please refer to it if you need help.
You will have to supply your own Ethereum address (or Private key if you solo mine). It is your own responsibility to mine to the correct address/account.
It is recommended to use your own web3api (e.g. Infura / Geth / Parity) if you solo mine, default value is for TESTING PURPOSE ONLY.
There is a default of 2.0% dev fee (Once every 50th nonce: starting from 11th if Pool mine, or starting from 50th if Solo mine).
You can set to the lowest 1.5% with "devFee=1.5" (the formula is "(nonce mod (100 / devFee)) = 0").
Dev fee in solo mining is by sending the current reward amount after the successful minted block, using the same gas fee as provided in 'gasToMine'.
In the case if the compute load for your GPU is not >= 99%, you can adjust the intensity via (amdIntensity/cudaIntensity/intelIntensity).

Please feedback your results and suggestions so that I can improve the miner. You can either add an issue in the repository, or find me in discord (Amano7). Thanks for trying out this miner!
